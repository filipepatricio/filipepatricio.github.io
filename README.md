## About
Hello, I'm Filipe, iOS Developer and (MSc)Master in Computer Science and Business Management.


The first Big mobile application I developed was MEO Cloud, while working on SAPO, released in 2014.

After that I decided to focus more on Apple Dev which is the environment that I'm pleased to use.


I'm passionate about Entrepreneurship, and all the environment around Start-ups with new tech products and/or services.

**_Technologies I mostly use:_**

* Objective-C
* Xcode
* Android Studio
* Java
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS (SASS, LESS)
* Git
* And more useful stuff
